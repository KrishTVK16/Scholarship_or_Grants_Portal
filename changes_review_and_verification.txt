POTENTIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
============================

1. CARDS WITHOUT H-100 CLASS
   ⚠ RISK: Low
   ⚠ DETAILS: Cards without "h-100" class won't have the flexbox alignment fixes
   ⚠ RECOMMENDATION: Check if there are any card sections that need h-100 class added

2. OTHER SECTIONS WITH CARDS

   ⚠ RISK: Low
   ⚠ DETAILS: Uses nth-child(2) selector - assumes Quick Links is always 2nd column
   ⚠ VERIFICATION: Confirmed Quick Links exists in all 13 HTML files
   ⚠ RECOMMENDATION: Verify footer structure is consistent across all pages

4. RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS

   - Mobile portrait (320px - 424px)
   - Small mobile (below 374px)

4. CHECK FOR MISSING SECTIONS:

CONCLUSION
==========

Overall, the changes are well-scoped and isolated. The main areas to verify:
1. All pages have consistent footer structure (Quick Links as 2nd column)
2. All card sections that need alignment have h-100 class
3. No other sections need similar font size reductions
4. Responsive behavior works correctly across all breakpoints

The changes should not negatively impact other alignments or interfaces, but manual testing is recommended to confirm.
